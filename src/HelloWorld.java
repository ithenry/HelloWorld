// The problem that this program solves, is that there is no
// Hello World! being printed. This program prints Hello World!
public class HelloWorld {
	//Do not want a return, and using a string as an argument
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//Print out Hello World
		System.out.println("Hello World!");

	}
