// The problem that this program solves, is that there is no
// Hello World! being printed. This program prints Hello World!

public class HelloWorld {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {//Do not want a return, and using a string as an argument
		
		System.out.println("Hello World!");//Print out Hello World

	}

}
